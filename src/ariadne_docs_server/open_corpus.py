"""The OPEN corpus spec: the public Project Ariadne protocol documents.

This is the *only* corpus the open server ever sees. It is drawn from the
public ``ariadne-protocol`` repo: the normative SPEC, its IMPLEMENTATION /
CONFORMANCE companions, the amendments still referenced for Layer-3 semantics,
plus GLOSSARY and CHANGELOG. Nothing proprietary. The enterprise corpus is a
separate spec in a separate (private) repo — never merged with this one.
