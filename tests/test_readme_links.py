"""README.md links must be absolute.

README.md is the package's long description, so PyPI renders it too. PyPI
resolves a relative link against pypi.org/project/<name>/, where no repository
file exists, so every relative link is dead there. Links into this repository
are absolute GitHub URLs, and each one names a file that exists.
